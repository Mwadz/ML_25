## Directory
### setup.py
setting up the machine learing model as a package helps build my entire machine learning applocation as a package and even deploy in Pi Pi

### requirements.txt


### .gitignore


### README.md


### src(folder)
once this is built, it becomes a resource and can be uploaded just like common packages ie. seaborn, pandas etc. The find_packages() function fetches and recognises the package through the __init__.py file. This is where the actual machine learning model is located
